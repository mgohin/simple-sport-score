# Simple Sport Score

### Download
You can get it here : [latest version](https://github.com/mgohin/simple-sport-score/releases/latest)

To use it it's very simple, open the `index.html` file in the `docs` folder and ... use it  :)

### Light
Very light and simple web page to display score between 2 teams or players.

### Oups! computer crashed
Data is kept in local storage of the browser so you can refresh page, names and scores will remain.

I'll keep this tool very simple.
