### Download
You can get it here : [latest version](https://github.com/mgohin/simple-sport-score/releases)
To use it it's very simple, open the `index.html` file in the `docs` folder and ... use it  :)

### Light
Very light and simple web page to display score between 2 teams or players.

### Oups computer crashed
Data is kept in local storage of the browser so you can refresh page, names and scores will remain.

Any request is welcome, you can create PR or just open an issue to ask a feature.
I'll keep this tool very simple.
